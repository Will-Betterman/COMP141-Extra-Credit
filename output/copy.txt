Hello! This is the text file for my comp141 extra credit!
In this text file I will talk about the significance of my favorite war!
This may seem silly, but the war itself was silly. The war in question is: The Great Emu War.
The Great Emu War was fought from the 2nd of november 1932 to the 10th of December of 1932
This time period was shortly after WWI and a large number of dishcharged veterans were given land in AustraliaFarming here was difficult and it worsened when approximately 20,000 emus migrated to their land. 
War was declared on the Emus and a total of 986 were killed. 
This had little impact on the overall population.
Overall this war is very interesting and just shows the different kinds of wars that have been fought.
Emus are actually very aggresive creatures and I would not want to go to war with 20,000 of them.
The war ended after multiple attempts and little progress.
