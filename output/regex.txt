Hello
This
the
text
file
for
extra
credit
this
text
file
will
talk
about
the
significance
favorite
war
This
may
seem
silly
but
the
war
itself
was
silly
The
war
question
The
Great
Emu
War
The
Great
Emu
War
was
fought
from
the
november
the
December
This
time
period
was
shortly
after
WWI
and
large
number
dishcharged
veterans
were
given
land
AustraliaFarming
here
was
difficult
and
worsened
when
approximately
emus
migrated
their
land
War
was
declared
the
Emus
and
total
were
killed
This
had
little
impact
the
overall
population
Overall
this
war
very
interesting
and
just
shows
the
different
kinds
wars
that
have
been
fought
Emus
are
actually
very
aggresive
creatures
and
would
not
want
war
with
them
The
war
ended
after
multiple
attempts
and
little
progress
